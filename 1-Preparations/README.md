# Preparations

*[05Mar15.12h40]*
* An archival APPRAISAL has been the first part in the process of putting together the Historioth√®que.
* I am in that process right now, as of March 5th, 2015, 12h40.

*[18Mar23.06h55]*
* In April, 2016, I moved the entire *Art Operation* to a new location, including the *Archives* (containing almost all my artistic and literary production going back to circa 1994-1995);
* I set up the new and improved __*Historiotheque*__ and began publishing *Official Releases* regularly, via __*Medium.com*__ and __*Twitter*__;
* I have inhabited and worked in this modular workspace since April,  2016;
