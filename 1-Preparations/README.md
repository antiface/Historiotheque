# Preparations

*[05Mar15.12h40]*
* An archival APPRAISAL has been the first part in the process of putting together the Historioth√®que.
* I am in that process right now, as of March 5th, 2015, 12h40.

*[18Mar23.06h55]*
* In April, 2016, I moved the entire *Art Operation* to a new location, including the *Archives* (containing almost all my artistic and literary production going back to circa 1994-1995);
* I set up the new and improved __*Historiotheque*__ and began publishing *Official Releases* regularly, via __*Medium.com*__ and __*Twitter*__;
* I have inhabited and worked in this modular workspace since April,  2016;
__*The Historiotheque*__ is currently on its [__*Official Release version 3.0.2*__](https://medium.com/historiotheque/the-rebirth-of-the-historiotheque-9680715034cb), and it's running just fine;
* *The Art Operation* starts up, starts producing art, publishes the lastest version of its *Official Release*, and then gets shut back down again;
* The reason *the entire operation shuts down* is that it is too destabilizing for me to be so __*PRODUCTIVE*__;
* I have always been a *prolific* artist, and now *The Art Operation at The Historiotheque* is so prolific when it starts up, that I start to lose sleep and slowly start to experience high levels of disorganization in my thoughts as well as the workspace itself;
* I then return to a calmer, more *Hygienic* life of doing *Research* and then *Publishing my Documentation*;
* I am currently in the process of publishing my *Research* and *Documentation*, as well as the *Series* of works I produced while the *Operation* was running;
* I will be re-lauunching *The Art Operation at The Historiotheque* shortly, after I heal fully from my last bout of disorganization/destabilization;
* The problem with a high-complexity art operation is that it grows in complexity and causes __*TURBULENCE*__;
* It causes turbulence for __*ME*__ and it also disturbs/disrupts/perturbs the people and spaces __*AROUND ME*__;
* So to summarize, *The Historiotheque* starts up and then shuts down at regular intervals, with a new semantic version of the *Official Release* when it starts up again, depending on what level it's reached in its *continuous development*;

*[24Nov23.09h50]*
* I started *Dismantling The (Physical) Archives*, meaning that I am am REDUCING the space it takes, removing what isn't necessary;
* I'm finishing ALL WORKS WHICH WERE LEFT UNFINISHED DUE TO INTERRUPTIONS/DISRUPTIONS/TURBULENCE;
* I'm creating __NEW PROJECTS__ put finalizing things on my __METHODOLOGY__ (and __DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING PUBLICLY, LEAVING A EASILY ACCESSIBLE, CITABLE AUDIT TRAIL__);
