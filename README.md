# Historiotheque
* The Historiothèque is the name that I have given to my Atelier, French for art studio.
* I am in the process of revamping the space and want to annotate, document, and archive the process of putting it together.
* Hopefully, in keeping this record of the building of the first official Historiothèque in human history, others will be able to follow suit and build their own.
* The Historiothèque, the name, is inspired in part by Paul Otlet's concept of "Mondothèque", in his conception of the Mundaneum in general.
