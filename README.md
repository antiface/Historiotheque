# Historiotheque
* __*The Historiothèque*__ is the name that I have given to my *Atelier*, French for art studio;
* I am in the process of revamping the space and want to annotate, document, and archive the process of putting it together;
* Hopefully, in keeping this record of the building of the first official *Historiothèque* in human history, others will be able to follow suit and build their own;
* __*The Historiothèque*__, the name, is inspired in part by Paul Otlet's concept of __*"Mondothèque"*__, in his conception of the *Mundaneum* in general;

## History of The Historiotheque Concept:
* In the city of Montreal, Quebec, in the summer of 2008, I lived in a duplex with 5-6 other people;
* These people had founded a non-profit organization which *"did philanthropy through the arts & culture"*;
* They were having their *Board Meetings* upstairs in my apartment and I was the official *Note-Taker*;
* I took the *minutes* and then had a quick 15-minute private meeting with the *President* to give him a breakdown of what I heard and saw during the meeting;
* I ended up also writing their *Mission* and *Vision* statements, for their organization, as well as all of the textual content for their website;
* I was also in charge of information security in the *Main Office*;
* At one point, I was asked to build an *Art Studio* or *Atelier* in a section of the *inner courtyard* which was covered with a ceiling (the rest of the courtyard was an open space, *exposed to the elements*;
* In the process of building the *Atelier*, I came up with the concept of a complete __*Art-House*__;
* Others must have had similar concepts before, but my *Vision* was *unique*;
* The Art-House was going to have a) an art studio and b) an archive;
* In essence, it would function as a kind of [__*Workspace*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/Workspace) as well as a *Museum* of sorts;
* I envisioned the *Museum* as being [__*The Museum of Modern Antiquity*__](https://medium.com/@antisignal/antique-moderne-or-the-museum-of-modern-antiquity-f3f914157a6d);
* The *Art-House* would have two floors, one for each storey of the duplex that would house it until we could build our own;
* The *Concept For The Art-House* quickly became the concept for my own *Art Studio*, which I came to called __*The Historiotheque*__;
* Later, I realized that my *Atelier* had always been a *Historiotheque*;
* That is to say, I had been living in, and then moving, my *Art Operation* in a studio space, i.e. *The Historiotheque*;

## What is the Historiotheque?:
* The term *Historiotheque* is a term I made up, basing myself on the Greek __*ἵστωρ (hístōr, “witness”)*__ and __*θήκη (thḗkē, “box, chest”)*__, essentially making it a __*Witness-Box*__;
* The simple idea was as with the original conception of the *Art-House*, namely, that it would house a *studio space* a.k.a. *The Art Operation* as well as an active *Archive*;
* The *Archive* would contain the entire documentary of the *Historiotheque* as well as kind of be a *History-House* for the local culture of __*The Historiotheque*__, and by *active archive* I meant that you would have archivists working in the archives every day;
* *The Archivists* would have the basic function of bringing value to the archive, essentially being like a *Library* for all the *Documentation* of the *art practices and work methods* of *The Historiotheque*;
* In my new vision of *The Historiotheque*, you could have a multiplicity of *Historiotheques* distributed across the land;
* It was a new kind of *Cultural Institution*, similar to a *Museum*, *Art Gallery*, and *Art Studio/Atelier*, yet different;
* What made it different was that you had both *The Art Operation* AND *Archives* housed in the same building;
* Later on, closer to 2009-2010, I began working with another non-profit organization which had a *Workshop Space*;
* I tried to integrate myself into the *Team*, but was never really able to do anything concrete with them;
* I did want to provide my services to clean up and rearrange their *Workspace* to make it more efficient and streamlined;
* I had been studying the principles and theory of [__*Axiomatic Design*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_design) and wanted to apply these to their *Workspace*;
* I never got to doing this, so I just focused on my own *Workspace* and so founded the first official __*Historiotheque*__;

## What happened after that?:
* Then what happened is that I designed my workspace to be __*MODULAR*__, with what I called *variable geometry*, to borrow a term once used in Quebec for a new theater they built;
* The space was *modular* in the sense that I could rearrange and reorganize the space *any way I wanted*, to do *anything I wanted*;
* The space was an *Art Studio/Atelier* during the day, and a *Recording Studio/Sound Laboratory* at night;
* I had already come up with a *Vision Statement* years prior for what I called __*The DesignWebLabs*__, which I called __*THE PILLARS OF DESIGN*__, a name which I later found out someone else had begun using, so I scrapped that idea;
* I wanted the *DesignWebLabs* to literally be a design studio, for visual and sound design, that was distributed over space, over any amount of space, i.e. *Globally* and so forth;
* All the design work would be done over the Internet, so in essence it was a *Distributed Virtual Workspace*;
* When that idea failed, after writing a functional specification, sharing it online, and trying to get people to help work on this *Project*, I took the *Web* out of *WebLabs* and just made it a *Design Lab*, which I called my *Laboratory* or *Art Operations Control Center*, or just *Art Operation*;

## Where is it going?:
* *The Historiotheque* has been in a new location for the last 7 years;
* It was the first thing I set up when I moved here, the *Studio Space* AND the *Archives*;
* Now it's running [__*The Historiotheque Official Release v.3.0.2*__](https://medium.com/historiotheque/the-rebirth-of-the-historiotheque-9680715034cb);
* The *Official Releases* are like the *Operating System* for the *Art Operation*;
* I'm going over the *Archives* with a fine-tooth comb, looking at all of the *interdisciplinary art-research projects* to find all the golden nuggets that resurface;
* I am publishing new and old works almost daily on social media, mostly images with accompanying, elucidating text, but also music and sound design;
* I'm also working on brand new projects which will officially be launching soon;
* I'm trying to write longer pieces on *Medium* about the complex conceptual systems behind *The Historiotheque* and its many *Projects*;
