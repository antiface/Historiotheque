*Stable Release v1.0.1* [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10360016.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10360016)

* __*The Historiothèque*__ is the name that I have given to my *Atelier*, French for art studio;
* I am in the process of revamping the space and want to annotate, document, and archive the process of putting it together;
* Hopefully, in keeping this record of the building of the first official *Historiothèque* in human history, others will be able to follow suit and build their own;
* __*The Historiothèque*__, the name, is inspired in part by Paul Otlet's concept of __*"Mondothèque"*__, in his conception of the *Mundaneum* in general;

## History of The Historiotheque Concept:
* In the city of Montreal, Quebec, in the summer of 2008, I lived in a duplex with 5-6 other people;
* These people had founded a non-profit organization which *"did philanthropy through the arts & culture"*;
* They were having their *Board Meetings* upstairs in my apartment and I was the official *Note-Taker*;
* I took the *minutes* and then had a quick 15-minute private meeting with the *President* to give him a breakdown of what I heard and saw during the meeting;
* I ended up also writing their *Mission* and *Vision* statements, for their organization, as well as all of the textual content for their website;
* I was also in charge of information security in the *Main Office*;
* At one point, I was asked to build an *Art Studio* or *Atelier* in a section of the *inner courtyard* which was covered with a ceiling (the rest of the courtyard was an open space, *exposed to the elements*;
* In the process of building the *Atelier*, I came up with the concept of a complete __*Art-House*__;
* Others must have had similar concepts before, but my *Vision* was *unique*;
* The Art-House was going to have a) an art studio and b) an archive;
* In essence, it would function as a kind of [__*Workspace*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/Workspace) as well as a *Museum* of sorts;
* I envisioned the *Museum* as being [__*The Museum of Modern Antiquity*__](https://medium.com/@antisignal/antique-moderne-or-the-museum-of-modern-antiquity-f3f914157a6d);
* The *Art-House* would have two floors, one for each storey of the duplex that would house it until we could build our own;
* The *Concept For The Art-House* quickly became the concept for my own *Art Studio*, which I came to called __*The Historiotheque*__;
* Later, I realized that my *Atelier* had always been a *Historiotheque*;
* That is to say, I had been living in, and then moving, my *Art Operation* in a studio space, i.e. *The Historiotheque*;

## What is the Historiotheque?:
* The term *Historiotheque* is a term I made up, basing myself on the Greek __*ἵστωρ (hístōr, “witness”)*__ and __*θήκη (thḗkē, “box, chest”)*__, essentially making it a __*Witness-Box*__;
* The simple idea was as with the original conception of the *Art-House*, namely, that it would house a *studio space* a.k.a. *The Art Operation* as well as an active *Archive*;
* The *Archive* would contain the entire documentary of the *Historiotheque* as well as kind of be a *History-House* for the local culture of __*The Historiotheque*__, and by *active archive* I meant that you would have archivists working in the archives every day;
* *The Archivists* would have the basic function of bringing value to the archive, essentially being like a *Library* for all the *Documentation* of the *art practices and work methods* of *The Historiotheque*;
* In my new vision of *The Historiotheque*, you could have a multiplicity of *Historiotheques* distributed across the land;
* It was a new kind of *Cultural Institution*, similar to a *Museum*, *Art Gallery*, and *Art Studio/Atelier*, yet different;
* What made it different was that you had both *The Art Operation* AND *Archives* housed in the same building;
* Later on, closer to 2009-2010, I began working with another non-profit organization which had a *Workshop Space*;
* I tried to integrate myself into the *Team*, but was never really able to do anything concrete with them;
* I did want to provide my services to clean up and rearrange their *Workspace* to make it more efficient and streamlined;
* I had been studying the principles and theory of [__*Axiomatic Design*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_design) and wanted to apply these to their *Workspace*;
* I never got to doing this, so I just focused on my own *Workspace* and so founded the first official __*Historiotheque*__;

## What happened after that?:
* Then what happened is that I designed my workspace to be __*MODULAR*__, with what I called *variable geometry*, to borrow a term once used in Quebec for a new theater they built;
* The space was *modular* in the sense that I could rearrange and reorganize the space *any way I wanted*, to do *anything I wanted*;
* The space was an *Art Studio/Atelier* during the day, and a *Recording Studio/Sound Laboratory* at night;
* I had already come up with a *Vision Statement* years prior for what I called __*The DesignWebLabs*__, which I called __*THE PILLARS OF DESIGN*__, a name which I later found out someone else had begun using, so I scrapped that idea;
* I wanted the *DesignWebLabs* to literally be a design studio, for visual and sound design, that was distributed over space, over any amount of space, i.e. *Globally* and so forth;
* All the design work would be done over the Internet, so in essence it was a *Distributed Virtual Workspace*;
* When that idea failed, after writing a functional specification, sharing it online, and trying to get people to help work on this *Project*, I took the *Web* out of *WebLabs* and just made it a *Design Lab*, which I called my *Laboratory* or *Art Operations Control Center*, or just *Art Operation*;

## Where is it going?:
* *The Historiotheque* has been in a new location for the last 7 years;
* It was the first thing I set up when I moved here, the *Studio Space* AND the *Archives*;
* Now it's running [__*The Historiotheque Official Release v.3.0.2*__](https://medium.com/historiotheque/the-rebirth-of-the-historiotheque-9680715034cb);
* The *Official Releases* are like the *Operating System* for the *Art Operation*;
* I'm going over the *Archives* with a fine-tooth comb, looking at all of the *interdisciplinary art-research projects* to find all the golden nuggets that resurface;
* I am publishing new and old works almost daily on social media, mostly images with accompanying, elucidating text, but also music and sound design;
* I'm also working on brand new projects which will officially be launching soon;
* I'm trying to write longer pieces on *Medium* about the complex conceptual systems behind *The Historiotheque* and its many *Projects*;

The Historiotheque, envisioned as a unique blend of art studio and active archive, presents a novel approach to preserving the documentary (cultural) heritage of humankind. Building upon existing efforts outlined previously, the Historiotheque offers several innovative strategies to further enhance the preservation and dissemination of cultural knowledge:

1. __Integrated Workspace and Archive__: The concept of the Historiotheque as both a studio space and an active archive fosters a symbiotic relationship between artistic creation and historical documentation. By housing the art operation alongside the archive, the Historiotheque ensures that documentation occurs concurrently with artistic production, facilitating the preservation of cultural heritage in real-time.

2. __Modular Design and Variable Geometry__: The modular design of the Historiotheque, with its variable geometry, allows for flexible adaptation to changing needs and functions. This adaptability not only enhances efficiency within the workspace but also enables the seamless integration of diverse artistic practices and interdisciplinary research projects, thereby enriching the archival content and cultural diversity preserved within the Historiotheque.

3. __Active Archivists and Value Creation__: The employment of archivists dedicated to the daily maintenance and enrichment of the archive ensures ongoing value creation within the Historiotheque. These archivists play a crucial role in curating, organizing, and annotating documentary materials, thereby transforming the archive into a dynamic repository of cultural knowledge accessible to both present and future generations.

4. __Digital Publication and Social Media Engagement__: Leveraging digital platforms such as social media and online publishing, the Historiotheque expands its reach and impact by disseminating archival content to a global audience. Through regular publication of images, text, music, and sound design, the Historiotheque facilitates public engagement with cultural heritage while fostering dialogue and exchange within the broader community.

5. __Interdisciplinary Art-Research Projects__: By actively engaging in interdisciplinary art-research projects, the Historiotheque generates new knowledge and insights that contribute to the preservation and interpretation of cultural heritage. These projects serve as creative expressions of cultural memory and identity, enriching the archive with diverse perspectives and narratives that reflect the complexity of human experience.

6. __Educational Initiatives and Knowledge Sharing__: The Historiotheque serves as a platform for educational initiatives and knowledge sharing, offering workshops, seminars, and exhibitions that engage the public in dialogue about the importance of preserving cultural heritage. Through these initiatives, the Historiotheque fosters a culture of appreciation for the arts and humanities while empowering individuals to become active participants in the preservation process.

In conclusion, the Historiotheque represents a pioneering model for the preservation of documentary heritage, blending artistic innovation with archival stewardship to safeguard the cultural treasures of humankind. By embracing principles of collaboration, adaptability, and public engagement, the Historiotheque demonstrates a commitment to sustaining the sacred fire of cultural knowledge across generations and ensuring that the lessons of history are learned and preserved for the benefit of humanity.

__The New Documentation: Enabling Continuous Delivery in Artistic Practice__

At the Historiotheque, we embrace "The New Documentation" as a fundamental aspect of our mission to revolutionize artistic practice through transparency, accountability, and reproducibility. Our approach to preserving the documentary (cultural) heritage of humankind involves implementing systematic documentation practices inspired by the principles outlined in "The New Documentation." Here's how we envision incorporating these practices into our operations:

1. __Foundations of The New Documentation__: We recognize the importance of transparency, integrity, responsibility, and reproducibility in documenting artistic processes. By adhering to these principles, we ensure that every aspect of our creative endeavors is meticulously logged and made publicly accessible.

2. __Continuous Logging__: Artists at the Historiotheque maintain detailed logs of their artistic processes, including ideation, research, experimentation, decision-making, and collaboration. These logs are continuously updated throughout the duration of each project, providing a comprehensive record of the creative journey.

3. __Public-Facing Spaces__: We publish our documentation in publicly accessible spaces, such as distributed revision control systems like Git repositories. This ensures that our documentation is available to anyone interested in our artistic work, fostering transparency and enabling others to learn from and build upon our processes.

4. __Versioning and Iteration__: Utilizing version control systems, such as Git, artists at the Historiotheque track changes in their work over time. This allows for iterative development, collaboration with other artists and researchers, and a transparent record of the evolution of each project.

5. __Documentation Standards__: We establish standards for documenting various aspects of artistic practice, including visual documentation, written reflections, annotations, and metadata. By adhering to these standards, we ensure consistency and clarity in our documentation practices.

6. __Peer Review and Feedback__: Artists at the Historiotheque actively engage in peer review and seek feedback from the artistic community to improve their documentation and refine their artistic processes. This collaborative approach fosters dialogue, exchange, and continuous improvement within our creative community.

By embracing "The New Documentation" and integrating its principles into our operations, the Historiotheque empowers artists to share their creative journey transparently, contribute to the collective knowledge of the artistic community, and preserve the documentary heritage of humankind for future generations. Through systematic documentation practices, we strive to democratize creativity, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and advance the boundaries of artistic innovation in the digital age.
