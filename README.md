# Historiotheque
* __*The Historiothèque*__ is the name that I have given to my *Atelier*, French for art studio;
* I am in the process of revamping the space and want to annotate, document, and archive the process of putting it together;
* Hopefully, in keeping this record of the building of the first official *Historiothèque* in human history, others will be able to follow suit and build their own;
* __*The Historiothèque*__, the name, is inspired in part by Paul Otlet's concept of __*"Mondothèque"*__, in his conception of the *Mundaneum* in general;

## History of The Historiotheque Concept:
* In the city of Montreal, Quebec, in the summer of 2008, I lived in a duplex with 5-6 other people;
* These people had founded a non-profit organization which *"did philanthropy through the arts & culture"*;
* They were having their *Board Meetings* upstairs in my apartment and I was the official *Note-Taker*;
* I took the *minutes* and then had a quick 15-minute private meeting with the *President* to give him a breakdown of what I heard and saw during the meeting;
* I ended up also writing their *Mission* and *Vision* statements, for their organization, as well as all of the textual content for their website;
* I was also in charge of information security in the *Main Office*;
* At one point, I was asked to build an *Art Studio* or *Atelier* in a section of the *inner courtyard* which was covered with a ceiling (the rest of the courtyard was an open space, *exposed to the elements*;
* In the process of building the *Atelier*, I came up with the concept of a complete __*Art-House*__;
* Others must have had similar concepts before, but my *Vision* was *unique*;
* The Art-House was going to have a) an art studio and b) an archive;
* In essence, it would function as a kind of [__*Workspace*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/Workspace) as well as a *Museum* of sorts;
* I envisioned the *Museum* as being [__*The Museum of Modern Antiquity*__](https://medium.com/@antisignal/antique-moderne-or-the-museum-of-modern-antiquity-f3f914157a6d);
* The *Art-House* would have two floors, one for each storey of the duplex that would house it until we could build our own;
* The *Concept For The Art-House* quickly became the concept for my own *Art Studio*, which I came to called __*The Historiotheque*__;
* Later, I realized that my *Atelier* had always been a *Historiotheque*;
* That is to say, I had been living in, and then moving, my *Art Operation* in a studio space, i.e. *The Historiotheque*;

## What is the Historiotheque?:
* The term *Historiotheque* is a term I made up, basing myself on the Greek __*ἵστωρ (hístōr, “witness”)*__ and __*θήκη (thḗkē, “box, chest”)*__, essentially making it a __*Witness-Box*__;
* The simple idea was as with the original conception of the *Art-House*, namely, that it would house a *studio space* a.k.a. *The Art Operation* as well as an active *Archive*;
* The *Archive* would contain the entire documentary of the *Historiotheque* as well as kind of be a *History-House* for the local culture of __*The Historiotheque*__;
* In my new vision of *The Historiotheque*, you could have a multiplicity of *Historiotheques* distributed across the land;
* It was a new kind of *Cultural Institution*, similar to a *Museum*, *Art Gallery*, and *Art Studio/Atelier*, yet different;
