# Historiotheque
* __*The Historiothèque*__ is the name that I have given to my *Atelier*, French for art studio;
* I am in the process of revamping the space and want to annotate, document, and archive the process of putting it together;
* Hopefully, in keeping this record of the building of the first official *Historiothèque* in human history, others will be able to follow suit and build their own;
* __*The Historiothèque*__, the name, is inspired in part by Paul Otlet's concept of __*"Mondothèque"*__, in his conception of the *Mundaneum* in general;

* I took the *minutes* and then had a quick 15-minute private meeting with the *President* to give him a summary of what I heard and saw during the meeting;
* I ended up also writing their *Mission* and *Vision* documents, for their organization;
* I was also in charge of information security in the *Main Office*;
* At one point, I was asked to build an *Art Studio* or *Atelier* in a section of the *inner courtyard* which was covered with a ceiling;
* In the process of building the *Atelier*, I came up with the concept of an __*Art-House*__;
* Others must have had similar concepts before, but my *Vision* was *unique*;
* The Art-House was going to have a) an art studio and b) an archive;
* In essence, it would function as a kind of [__*Workspace*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/Workspace) as well as a *Museum* of sorts;
* I envisioned the *Museum* as being *The Museum of Modern Antiquity*;
